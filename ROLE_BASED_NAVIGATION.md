# Role-Based Navigation Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of role-based navigation that restricts access to certain pages based on user roles.

## Changes Made

### 1. EnhancedHeader Component (`frontend/src/components/EnhancedHeader.jsx`)
- **Modified navigation items array** to conditionally include Templates and Team pages
- **Role-based filtering**: Templates and Team navigation items are only shown for managers and admins
- **User role check**: Uses `userRole !== "user"` to determine visibility

```javascript
const navigationItems = [
  { id: "dashboard", label: "Dashboard", icon: BarChart3 },
  { id: "list", label: "Proposals", icon: FileText },
  // Templates - Only for managers and admins
  ...(userRole !== "user" ? [{ id: "templates", label: "Templates", icon: FileTemplate }] : []),
  // Team - Only for managers and admins
  ...(userRole !== "user" ? [{ id: "team", label: "Team", icon: Users }] : []),
]
```

### 2. App Component (`frontend/src/App.jsx`)
- **Added navigation validation** in `handleNavigate` function
- **Role-based access control**: Prevents users from accessing restricted pages even if they try to navigate directly
- **User feedback**: Shows alert message when access is denied

```javascript
const handleNavigate = (view) => {
  const userRole = getUserRoleWithFallback()
  
  // Check if user is trying to access restricted pages
  if (userRole === "user" && (view === "templates" || view === "team")) {
    alert("You don't have permission to access this page. Only managers and administrators can access Templates and Team pages.")
    return
  }
  
  setCurrentView(view)
  setSelectedProposal(null)
}
```

## Role Permissions

### User Role ("user")
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Full access
- ✅ **Proposals**: Full access (view, edit, submit back to manager)
- ❌ **Templates**: Hidden from navigation, access denied
- ❌ **Team**: Hidden from navigation, access denied

### Manager Role ("manager")
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Full access
- ✅ **Proposals**: Full access (create, edit, assign, update status)
- ✅ **Templates**: Full access (create, edit, manage)
- ✅ **Team**: Full access (view team members, assign proposals)

### Admin Role ("admin")
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Full access
- ✅ **Proposals**: Full access (all manager permissions plus admin features)
- ✅ **Templates**: Full access (all manager permissions plus admin features)
- ✅ **Team**: Full access (all manager permissions plus admin features)

## Implementation Details

### Navigation Filtering
- Uses JavaScript spread operator with conditional arrays
- Maintains clean, readable code structure
- Preserves existing navigation order for authorized users

### Security Measures
- **Frontend validation**: Prevents navigation to restricted pages
- **User feedback**: Clear error messages when access is denied
- **Consistent behavior**: Both desktop and mobile navigation respect role restrictions

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Role-based filtering applies to both desktop and mobile navigation
- Mobile menu items are filtered using the same logic
- Consistent user experience across all device types

## Testing Scenarios

### User Role Testing
1. **Login as user**: Verify Templates and Team links are hidden
2. **Direct navigation attempt**: Try to access `/templates` or `/team` - should show access denied alert
3. **Mobile navigation**: Verify restricted items don't appear in mobile menu

### Manager/Admin Role Testing
1. **Login as manager**: Verify all navigation items are visible
2. **Login as admin**: Verify all navigation items are visible
3. **Navigation functionality**: Verify all pages are accessible

## Future Enhancements
- **Route-level protection**: Add React Router guards for additional security
- **Permission-based components**: Hide specific UI elements within pages based on roles
- **Audit logging**: Track navigation attempts to restricted areas
- **Custom error pages**: Replace alert messages with styled error components
